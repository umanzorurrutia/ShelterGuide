# ShelterGuide
## Inspiration
One of our team members mentored a team of students in a Business Program. Those students were passionate about the homeless crisis and finding an innovative solution. That inspired us to create ShelterGuide.
## What it does
ShelterGuide utilizes technology and innovative algorithms to connect the homeless with the nearest shelters! With a tap, they can access the assistance they require.
## How we built it
We created the ShelterGuide website with HTML/CSS and utilized a JavaScript backend to develop the algorithms that guide homeless people to shelters in the San Diego area. The project is scalable and we plan to develop it further in the future.
